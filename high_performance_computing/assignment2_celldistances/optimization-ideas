Memory managemant:
	- Remove matrix and only use the 3n int array.

Calculate distance
	- Implement own version of sqrt using that we have a given tolerance - while loop
	with a converging series.

Parallelization
	- Keep file open during the whole execution of program and move around using fseek.
	If we keep opening/closing the file in read data we may have problem with threads 
	not being able to access it.

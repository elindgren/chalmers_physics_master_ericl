Notes for oral exam in HPC 2020

Exam topic: Impact of synchronization between compute units in OpenCL. 

Specific question: Optimizing the local size.

Good resources: 
	Discussion on local size - https://stackoverflow.com/a/3959831
	Optimizing local memory - https://stackoverflow.com/a/28537318

Naive approach: No local size, i.e. the local work group size will be chosen by the compiler.

Our approach: We just set the local size to {10, 10}

Optimization: Try to optimize the local size. Note that the local size 
	      should be a multiple of the global size, and preferably 
	      a multiple of 32/64 as well.


*********** Benchmarks **********
All benchmark performed using hyperfine, with 2 warmup iterations.

Baseline: Naive approach

Timings measured in code.
Linear/jumping reflects initialization, direct means direct access of x and y. 
What do they mean with alternative implementation? Remove all initialization of the p vector?

Results:
	- O0::
		Linear: 4.3mus
		Jumping: 9.5mus
		Direct: 2.1mus
	- O2::
		Linear: 1.0mus
		Jumping: 8.8mus
		Direct: 0.55mus
	- O2nat::
		Linear: 1.0mus
		Jumping: 8.8mus
		Direct: 0.55mus

Analysis:

We see that 1inear is faster than the jumping access. We also note that it is quicker to 
access directly.

C Program::

Results: 
	HDD::
		Byte write: 14.4 mus/iter - 278 MB/s
		Byte read: 13.9 mus/iter - 288 MB/s
		Array write: 0.2 mus/iter - 20000 MB/s
		Array read: 0.2 mus/iter - 20000 MB/s
	SSD::
		Byte write: 13.5 mus/iter - 296 MB/s
		Byte read: 13.7 mus/iter - 292 MB/s
		Array write: 0.1 mus/iter - 40000 MB/s
		Array read: 0.1 mus/iter - 40000 MB/s

Analysis: 
	We note that the SSD is slightly faster than the HDD, but
	we also note that the numbers for array (synchronous) 
	read/write are completely ridicolous. 
	SSDs should be much faster, particularly for random
	(location) reads and writes. When it comes to writing single
	bytes one after another (onto the same spot on the SSD)
	the difference is smaller. 

Bash program::

Results:
	HDD::
		Average copy time: 0.70s
	SSD::
		Average copy time: 0.70s

Analysis: 
	These results are inline with the results from the C program,
	but they are intuitively strange. Why bother if there is no 
	difference between HDD and SSD?

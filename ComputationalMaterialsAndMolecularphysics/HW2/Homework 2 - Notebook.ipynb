    "Initializes the system for a given number N of Na atoms. The script is composed of a main function which initializes the system, using several helper functions. First, arguments given to the script are parsed, and a database file (gadb.db) and a Lennard-Jones-potential-based calculator (calc) are created. Then, the cluster is created with N Na-atoms. The function 'closest_distances_generator' is used to find the smallest possible initial bond lengths, which are then passed to the class 'StartGenerator' which takes care of creating starting candidates for our Na cluster. After the slab parameters, which define the volume available to our system, of our StartGenerator are set we use StartGenerator to generate population_size number of starting candidates. These are generated by first adding an atom at (0,0,0), after which the rest of the N atoms are added iteratively by randomly trying different angles and positions next to the already placed atoms. The atoms are placed at the bond-distance calculated using the 'closest_distances_generator' from ASE. Each obtained starting cluster is then relaxed using the Lennard-Jones potential. Finally, all of the (unrelaxed?) candidates are saved to the database file. "

Then, they are each relaxed for 100 steps using calc and saved back to gadb.db. These relaxed candidates are also added to our population-object. Then, the genetic algorithm (GA) starts. For each of the ncandidates_to_test, two random candidates out of the population are selected and \"paired\" to create a third candidate. \"Pairing\" in this sense means that atoms from both parents are \"sliced-out\" and combined to form a new candidate. With a certain probablilty mutation_probability a random mutation is also added to the new candidate by performing some operation, such as mirroring, rattle or permutation of the atoms. The new candidate is the relaxed, and added to the population after which the process is repeated. \n",
